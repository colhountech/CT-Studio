# Ch1-3

In this Chapter we work with signing users in with Work
or School accounts or Microsoft personal accounts.

Change the  tenantId to common when created the dotnet app e.g.
```
"--tenant-id common"
```
That's all. Now your web app will support work and school accounts AND
microsoft personal accounts.
